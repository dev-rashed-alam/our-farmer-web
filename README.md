## Motivation
The agriculture industry is the backbone of many economies, providing essential food and raw
materials. However, farmers often face significant challenges, including climate change, soil-related
problems, funding and loan difficulties, and issues related to consumer satisfaction and crop sales.
On the other hand, consumers encounter problems like health issues and a lack of access to hygienic
and fresh foods. To address these challenges, we will develop Our Farmer, a collaborative platform
designed to connect farmers and consumers, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship.
